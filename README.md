## ðŸ“‹ Todo

This program is currently WIP, help me finish it.

Here is the main roadmap :

### Features

- [X] Login support
- [X] List  of products
- [ ] Detail each product (vehicles in first, then energy sites and Powerwalls)
- [ ] Support car settings
- [ ] Support vehicles commands like car unlocking...

### Others

- [ ] Catch API errors (like unauthorized)
- [ ] Code reorganization (it's a noob code that discovers Rust)
- [ ] Test the program (#shame)
- [ ] Add a CI/CD (Tavis ?)
- [ ] Add the right license (Free and prohibit any commercial use)
- [ ] And, create issues for all these points
